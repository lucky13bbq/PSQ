# PSQ: A C++ multithreaded Pipeline based on Shared Queues

A C++ header-only library that has no dependencies and consists of only four header files:
1. TimestampedData.h
2. Queue.h
3. VectorOfQueues.h
4. BaseThread.h

# Disclaimer
I am not a C++ concurrency expert so please use at your own risk and let me know what can be improved.

# Overview
Was looking for an easy way to process data from multiple sensors or cameras in a flexible multithreaded C++ pipeline. While other pipeline libraries exist such as YAPP (https://github.com/picanumber/yapp), we sought a solution with flexible pipeline configurations that would allow a) multiple threads (e.g. sensors, cameras) to write to a common vector of queues and b) subsequent threads to read data generated and provided by one of more input threads that they could use to generate new data.

As such, our multithreaded pipeline is based on shared queues or shared vector of queues to share data between threads. To signal new data, we use condition variables to notify and wake the waiting thread(s). 

Notes: 
* A thread should only wait on one condition variable so in the case of a thread that reads from multiple threads, you will need to choice which thread it should wait on.
* Data are timestamped as soon as they are recorded by the sensor or camera.
* Threads are supposed to stop waiting and wake up when new timestamped data are available.

# Usage Tips
* User designed threads should inherit from BaseThread
* Call Queue::push_back() or VectorOfQueues::push_back() to write new data for other threads to read
* Call Queue::back(), Queue::copyQueue(), VectorOfQueues::back(), VectorOfQueues::copyVector() to read data
* Call Queue::backButWaitNewData(), Queue::copyQueueButWaitNewData(), VectorOfQueues::backButWaitNewData(), VectorOfQueues::copyVectorButWaitNewData() to wait for and read new data when available

## Sample Code
To see how you could use this library, please see the provided sample code in which we implement the following simplified pipeline:

Each box represents a thread. Multiple random number generators write to a common vector of queues. You may change the random number generation frequency to match your sensor frequency as desired e.g. 30Hz. Subsequent threads use these data to generate new data that they write to their own output queues, except for Viewer which does not generate any data.

You may use CodeBlocks to compile and run.

Good luck and hope this helps someone!
